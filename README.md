# 8-1Mux

-This is a mini project to design and implement an 8:1 multiplexer (MUX) using three Verilog modeling styles â€“ Behavioral Model, Dataflow model, Structured model.

Every modeling approach adds different perspective view and advantages, reflecting some abstraction in digital circuit concrete design.

 -This work illustrates the ways in which these methodologies may be used together to understand how MUXs function, suggesting a higher level design prior low-level hardware realisation.
